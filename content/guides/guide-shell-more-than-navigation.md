_This guide is generally adapted to working in a UNIX environment using the bash shell, but there are various nods to Mac and Windows, which have some differences. Demonstrations during class assume use of Mac OS/Unix style terminal commands. However, commands for both unix and windows environments are offered below. See the linked resources at the bottom for greater detail._



This guide is intended to offer additional information about the `find` `grep` command.
That section, however, remains under development, so for the time being,
please consult the related [command reference slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OZyh3pcNeZ2NIyGptQuR_idpbW9SbMe0ZLuAtsr8Q14/edit?usp=sharing).
