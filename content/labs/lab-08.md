This lab asks you to explore the BagIt file packaging structure, which was discussed in class. This is a file-level information package, which contains basic descriptive information as well as PDI. Because it relies on operating system level information, it can be readily created for local files, and various tools support its creation. In this week's lab, the BagIt library in python was demonstrated. This can be run in a standalone `.py` file. But, for this lab, you are welcome to use the Jupyter notebook from the samples at: <https://github.com/morskyjezek/bagit-walkthrough-lcwa>.

To demonstrate completion of this lab, please upload a valid BagIt bag of the directory `PKG-web-files-small` from the course files. In addition, answer the following questions:

1. In what situations might the BagIt specification and the python-based bagit library be useful?
2. Refer to the Levels of Digital Preservation grid. For what boxes in the grid do you see this tool as potentially useful?
3. If you were going to incorporate this into a workflow, at what sorts of steps/actions do you think you could integrate this sort of tool?
