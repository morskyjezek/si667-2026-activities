## In this lab you will

- Engage with the CoreTrustSeal requirements.
- Create a hexagonal diagram from a list of concepts.
- Explain your choices.

## What to submit

Upload 1 PDF to Canvas.

## Instructions

_**Note:** you may work on the diagrams in small groups in class, but must each submit your own reflection in Canvas._

- First, review the provided information about the CoreTrustSeal and its checklist. Make sure to understand what the CoreTrustSeal is, why it's important, and what each item on the checklist means.
- Prepare Your Hexagons: On each hexagonal card or sticky note (or digital equivalent), write a different criterion from the CoreTrustSeal checklist. You should end up with a hexagon for each item on the checklist.
  - You may use the following template if you like, or you can create your own diagram using pen & paper, or  any tool of your choice: [Lab 6: CTS Hexagons Template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1IZRojEJeeyK50xKYaaTWsUkfKjpzUlYRcXyImBJV00U/edit?usp=sharing).
- Analyze the Criteria: Consider each criterion and think about its meaning, importance, and implications. How does each criterion contribute to the trustworthiness of digital repositories?
- Creating Connections: Start to arrange your hexagons to visually represent the connections you see between the different criteria. You can place connecting sides together to show direct relationships. Don't forget to consider indirect relationships and how different criteria may impact one another.
- Write About Your Connections: Choose three connections between criteria that you find particularly interesting or surprising. Write a brief explanation about each connection. Make sure to explain what each criterion is, how they are connected, and why you find this connection significant.
- Once you have completed your hexagonal connections and written your explanations, submit your work as a single PDF that includes your hexagonal diagram AND your written work.
- **Tips:**
  - This assignment isn't about finding "right" or "wrong" connections. Rather, it's an exploration of the interrelatedness of the different aspects of the CoreTrustSeal checklist. So, be creative and thoughtful in your approach.
  - Your written explanations are a chance to demonstrate your understanding of the CoreTrustSeal and its checklist. Be thorough and detailed in explaining your chosen connections.
