## Glitched Files

The responses and changes that you make to your files when creating "bit rot art"
will vary widely. In general, the process involves opening the file in a hex editor,
then changing or deleting some of the bytes to see what will happen.
You can "see" the results by reopening the file in an image viewer.

## Lab Activities/Questions

Record answers for the following questions:

1. Modify at least one jpg and one tif file. Note the original name of the files that you modified, and the name of the file that you uploaded to the online gallery/folder.
2. Describe what changed and how this affected the rendering of the files. What was most interesting or challenging about this process?

* _Results will vary, but generally, there may be some color changes, skewing, shift of the image, or visual artifacts and changes introduced in parts of the image._
