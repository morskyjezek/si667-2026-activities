You will find the lab description at [the lab assignment on Canvas]({{< pagevar canvas_link >}}).

## Learning Goals

This lab asks you to go beyond "screen essentialism" and experience different ways of looking at and modifying files. You will work on:

- How to view files at the raw bitstream level (focus on the "informational" view of digital information)
- Use tools that help to view digital encodings, through examples of text and images
How to alter the raw bitstream and an exploratory approach to what those alterations produce

## Useful Tools

- You should have a hex editor extension for VS Code. You can use the Hex EditorLinks to an external site. or Hex Inspector. (To install an extension, you can search in VS Code, then click the green install button.)
- If your VS Code extensions aren't working well, try an online hex viewer, like <https://hexed.it/>.
- Find the files in the `bit-rot-lab` folder of the course shared files, [linked here](https://github.com/morskyjezek/si667-2026/tree/main/bit-rot-lab).

## What to submit

You should submit one file that answers the lab questions below here on Canvas, and also [upload a glitched jpg and a glitched tiff file to the shared folder](https://github.com/morskyjezek/si667-2026/tree/main/bit-rot-lab). (Remember that it may take a few tries to get something that renders a visually noticeable or interesting new file.) Other files will be generated during your activities, but only share two of the most interesting glitched files. We will view the files next week and during next class! 

## Lab Activities/Questions

Record answers for the following questions:

1. Modify at least one jpg and one tif file. Note the original name of the files that you modified, and the name of the file that you uploaded to the online gallery/folder.
2. Describe what changed and how this affected the rendering of the files. What was most interesting or challenging about this process?
